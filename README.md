### Pset6     
**Mario**     
*Description:* Implement a program that prints a double half pyramid, inspired by the video game Mario.     
*What I learnt:* Practice working with print statements in python and validating user input.    


**Credit**     
*Description:*     
*What I learned:* Validating user input in python using the regular expression module re. The need to be careful when converting C code into python with floor division which is // in python.     


**DNA**\
*Description* Write a python program that takes a DNA sequence and checks for a possible match in a dna database. By checking for consequtive STR repeats in the DNA sequence\
*What I learnt:* I learned how easy it is to work with python especially when it comes to string manipulation. As Strings in python are an object type with their own methods that can act on them. In a language like C, strings are actually pointers to a char as they are not a defined object type. C programs however run faster on average becuase when one runs a C program, they are running machine code which is what is produced from the compile stage. As python is an interpreted language - it has to be translated line by line into machine language and this adds onto the running time of a program. In addition with python you are using a librabry of code with allot of things already prebuilt for you and some of these solutions would be more general purpose solutions as opposed to a very specific one that you might code for your problem and this could make the code run slower than a C program.\

### Pset7
**MOVIES**  
*Description:* Write 12 sql queries to answer questions on movies in the imdb database.  
*What I learnt:* How to write sql queries, compute averages and combine tables.  

**Fiftyville**      
*Description:* Write sql queries to query a database of various tables inorder to solve a crime. To find out who stole the CS50 duck, which city the thief is headed to and who the accomplice is.\
*What I learnt:* I got lots of practice writing sql queries, escpecially nested sql queries to combine tables. I also learned how efficient an sql database is at storing large amounts of data while using the least amount of space. I also learned about normalisations and using join tables to reduce data redundancies.
### Pset8
**Lab8**     
*Description:* Create a trivia question game, one with buttons to select and the other a free response question which will react to user input. When the user selects the correct answer for examply the button will turn green and text will appear below saying "Correct!"    
*What I learnt:* I learned how to make web pages dynamic using JavaScript code by adding script tags in the html page. The script tag can be added at the bottom of the body section so that the contents of the document have hopefully all been loaded OR the script tags can be added in the head section. When the script tags are in the head section you can add some logic to check that the contents of the DOM have all loaded before the javascript code can run otherwise you may get an error.
    
**HOMEPAGE**   
*Description:* Create a simple webpage that introduces me, my favourite hobby or extracurricular activities.  
*What I learnt:* .
